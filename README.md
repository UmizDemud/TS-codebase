## Description

This site will be the base for the produced code. And it should serve as a dependable notebook for whoever it may concern. As the code here follows the best practices and my other repositories are more like runaway scientist labaratories. You can't learn in depth without getting your hands in mud... 

## Installation

Run an npm install for getting the packages I may be using:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
